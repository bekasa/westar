    <h2>Swimming Pool Construction, Renovation and Repair</h2>
    
    <div>
    <p>Westar Pools were established on the Costa del Sol in 2001, and since that time have built and renovated many, many pools for individuals and urbanizations. We were constantly being asked:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you build a retaining wall ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you relay my patio ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Do you supply and fit decking ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you create individual logos for pools ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you build a Jacuzzi into my pool ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you landscape my garden ?</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    <dt class="font-bold">Can you build a luxury outdoor living space</dt>
    <dl>YES</dl>
    </dl>
    </div>
    <p>And so we became the company we are today. If we canâ€™t do something, we know a man that can.</p>
